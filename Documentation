Project Architecture:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: The TCGABiolinks R package is used to load and preprocess mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and proteome profiling files from the TCGA-OV project on the GDC portal.
  Clinical data (ov_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_clinical_data) is downloaded directly from cBioPortal.
- Obtaining Multiomics Matrix: Each preprocessed single-omic is concatenated with the other to form the multi-omics data frame used for further analysis.
- Dimensionality reduction: The multi-omics data frame is dimensionality reduced using both AutoEncoder and PCA algorithms to compare clusters resulting from both. 
- Consensus k-means clustering: reduced data frames are clustered using Consensus k-means clustering algorithms.
- Survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier analysis is performed to determine if there exists any difference in the survival between the clusters obtained. 
- Visualization: tSNE plots for clusters obtained from original and reduced data are visualized. 

Design Decisions:
- Data Preprocessing: Drop features with zero expression in more than 20% of samples in mRNA and miRNA but 10% in DNA methylation and proteome profiling, impute missing values, and apply min-max normalization. 
- Obtaining Multiomics Matrix: Concatenate all data types by common sample ids. 
- Consensus k-means clustering evaluation: Choose k-clusters based on the lowest ambiguously clustered pairs that are quantified using the cumulative distribution function.
- Survival analysis evaluation: Check the p-value obtained from the log-rank test. 

Algorithms Used:
- AutoEncoder neural network: Used as the base architecture for dimensionality reduction.
- PCA: Used also for dimensionality reduction to validate the accuracy of AutoEncoder.

Dependencies:
- TCGABiolinks, SummarizedExperiment,sesameData, sesame, tidyverse, and maftools for dowloading the data.
- TensorFlow for AutoEncoder learning tasks.
- scikit-learn for imputing missing values while preprocessing the data and PCA.
- Matplotlib for visualizing data and results.
- ConsensusClusterPlus, survival, survminer, ggplot2, data.table for clustering and survival analysis.
